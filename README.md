- 👋 Hi, I’m @breadstick-xd
- 👀 I’m interested in - neural networks, though they're a rather new idea to me, as I've spent a lot of my time programming games (none were good enough or complete enough to be shared though I plan to change that)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - python (I've been learning for about 5 years, still learning) and gdscript, Godot's built-in language 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - I'm not too sure right now - collaboration on group projects seems like a new, stressful and scary idea, but I may find something, or it may find me.
